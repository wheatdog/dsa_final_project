Hi, I am happy to type here again. I took some time to merge this file.
Ok, Let's build a fucking awesome bank account system.

Hi, how many noses does Jacky have?

How to push if the version on github is newer than local?
git pull
merge file yourself - ('git status' to check the files both modified)
git commit -m "something"  (this is your merge message)
git push
